DungeonManager is tool for managing DnD campaigns, employing an SQLite backend and built with Qt C++.
The project in this repository can be dropped into Qt Creator and *should* build on Linux with minimal gnashing of teeth.
The aim of this project is to bring the functionality of web-based DnD services to the local machine.

<h1>Update! As of 4/14/2020 </h1>

  <li>Stats are now persistant, and can be loaded with the "Open database" menu item.

<h1>As of 4/13/2020:</h1>

Will begin incorporating some content generation features from the OpenRPG project, and hopefully contribute some useful stuff there for them as well. Continuing development on a native character sheet frontend, and some extra features not currently in OpenRPG.

  <li>Saved files can now be opened!
  <li>Stat and skill fields in place, and their respective fields present; no connection between the two as of yet

<h1>As of 4/9/20:</h1>
Basic functionality for certain items is in place, with some exceptions:

  <li>No opening saved files
  <li>Not many fields in place


While no official roadmap exists (feel free to propose one), there are a number of features to be included, such as:

  <li>LAN play, with integrated DM and Player permission sets
  <li>Configurable RNG
  <li>Soundboard
  <li>Export tools (zip, tar, text logging)
  <li>More robust player/NPC management view

With more time and resources:

  <li>Integrated web server for players
  <li>Graphical dice roller
